# Starting off
## How am I feeling?
Not bad at the moment, but wasn't good at all earlier. My circadian rhythm hasn't been fixed yet. So cortisol (a stress hormone which is essential to wake up) isn't produced at the right time. After running and coming back, I was stuck and daydreaming. Now, finally, I got up and begun to crush the day.
# The afternoon
## A strong headache
Yes, I am having a long-lasting headache because of dopamine withdrawal. I am struggling to be active, my body is weak, brain is screaming. I was able to do some work by force, but inefficient and short. For example, I am trying to show my current state by writing it down forcefully. I don't think lying down with the hope of magic which will never exist. My current plan is to exercise, run to normalize the hormones in my body. It sucks, but doesn't pose a threat. In fact, I am taking the ownership and full potential of my body slowly by suffering. It will happen one day, not now (Rome wasn't built in a day).
