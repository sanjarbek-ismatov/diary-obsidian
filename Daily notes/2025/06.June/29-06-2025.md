# The morning
## A bit improved 
Although my waking-up experience is not highly optimized yet, I am beginning to realize that something shifting in my sleep schedule. Gradually, falling asleep is becoming much quicker and easier. I am slowly becoming an early bird by getting up at the same time every day.
## Again?
Despite improvements in my sleep and other areas, my brain is still screaming for me to stop. Every time I wake up, I have very little motivation to get up, run, and start the day. My brain literally says, 'Again?, oh, come on!'. I admit that it is happening, but it is perfectly normal for my situation. After all, my brain had been producing a massive amount of dopamine with no real purpose, so now it has to undergo a heavy dopamine fast. It naturally panics, increases my libido, and tries to convince me to relapse.
