# Greeting after my absence
I am still here after being absent. Yesterday I relapsed a couple of times, went to sleep pretty late, got up very late too. But today, instead of continuing indulging in those activities, I changed the course and finally come back to life. This time, I am being more serious by restricting access to several websites, removing programs. I am not going to be victim of my own self again.
