# Another day
It's been a quite while since I wrote something here. But from now, I'm gonna stay active there as long as I can. 
## I stopped thinking about loneliness
Yes, surprisingly, I started feeling amazing and stopped seeking attention (to some extent). Because, thanks to ChatGPT, I realized one thing: loneliness is the way to mature, not to suffer. So, although it kind of sucks to feel loneliness, I shifted my mindset to think positively.
## I get mature when I stop panic in loneliness
Most people miss one truth: you grow when you move forward despite lacking motivation and you mature when you don't chase anyone, panic when you are lonely. You have to build yourself by yourself, otherwise you'll miss the characteristics: self-reliance and emotional independence. 
## Okay, will I care about others?
It depends on the person, but for making a relationship, I'll stay away from anyone to protect the momentum. Why? Because I want to be alone to fix my mistakes and rebuild the person I have forgotten. Along this way, nobody should help me in any sense. It's only me.
