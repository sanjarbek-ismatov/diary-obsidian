# Introduction to my notes again
It's been a long time since I wrote notes here. Today I'm glad to remind you that my notes are still alive and I will continue writing notes here.
## I deleted my Telegram channels
Yes, that's true. No matter how ridiculous it sounds, I deleted my channels without letting anyone know. I don't care about those channels anymore. My mission is to revive and build myself from scratch. Telegram was very annoying.
## MIUI sucks, but I don't care (for now)
I would like to ditch MIUI and flash LineageOS, but thanks to my quick decision, I locked the bootloader and now, it's kind of impossible to unlock it. However, the ROM experience is smooth and quite usable. So why bother? A true soldier doesn't require a specific weapon, he fights with whatever he has, right? The same thing applies to a programmer. Who care what you use? Does it work, if yes, don't change it.
